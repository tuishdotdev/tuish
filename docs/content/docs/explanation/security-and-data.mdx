# Security and Data

Tuish is designed with privacy and security as core principles. This page explains our approach.

## Design Philosophy

### Offline-First = Privacy-First

Traditional licensing requires "phone home" checks:

```
❌ Traditional: App ──▶ Server (every run) ──▶ Track user
```

Tuish uses cryptographic verification:

```
✅ Tuish: App ──▶ Local verification (no network)
```

This means:
- No tracking of when users run your app
- No dependency on Tuish servers being online
- No data collection from end users

## What Data We Collect

### Developer Data (You)

| Data | Purpose | Storage |
|------|---------|---------|
| Email address | Account management | Cloudflare D1 |
| Stripe account ID | Payment processing | Cloudflare D1 |
| Product details | License generation | Cloudflare D1 |
| API usage metrics | Service improvement | Aggregated only |

### End User Data (Your Customers)

| Data | Purpose | Storage |
|------|---------|---------|
| License key | Verification | User's machine only |
| Machine fingerprint | Machine binding | In license token |

**We do not collect:**
- Personal information from end users
- Usage telemetry
- IP addresses (except in standard server logs)
- Behavioral data

## Data Flow

### License Issuance

```
1. Customer pays (Stripe handles card data)
2. Tuish generates license token
3. Token sent to customer's machine
4. Token stored locally (~/.tuish/)
5. No ongoing data collection
```

### License Verification

```
1. App loads license from disk
2. App verifies signature locally
3. No network call
4. No data sent anywhere
```

### Cache Refresh (Every 24h)

```
1. SDK sends license key and machine fingerprint to Tuish API
2. API verifies license and returns validity status
3. Only license key and machine fingerprint transmitted
```

## Security Measures

### Cryptographic Security

| Component | Algorithm | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| License signing | Ed25519 | Tamper-proof licenses |
| API key hashing | SHA-256 | Developer authentication |
| API keys | Cryptographically random | Authentication |
| Machine fingerprints | SHA-256 | Machine binding |

### Infrastructure Security

| Component | Provider | Security |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| API | Cloudflare Workers | Edge computing, DDoS protection |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 | Encrypted at rest |
| Secrets | Cloudflare Secrets | Encrypted storage |
| DNS | Cloudflare | DNSSEC |

### API Security

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Transport | TLS 1.3 only |
| Authentication | API keys + rate limiting |
| CORS | Strict origin policy |
| Input validation | All endpoints validated |

## Threat Model

### What We Protect Against

| Threat | Protection |
|--------|------------|
| License forgery | Ed25519 signatures |
| License tampering | Signature verification |
| License sharing | Machine binding |
| Replay attacks | Machine fingerprint binding + expiration timestamps |
| Man-in-the-middle | TLS + signature verification |
| Server compromise | Offline verification still works |

### What We Don't Protect Against

| Threat | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Binary patching | Determined users can bypass |
| Clock manipulation | Users can backdate system |
| Key extraction | Public key is extractable |

Tuish provides "honest user" protection—sufficient for most commercial software. For high-security needs, consider additional measures.

## Machine Fingerprinting

Machine fingerprints bind licenses to specific devices:

```
fingerprint = SHA256(hostname + username + platform + arch)
```

### Privacy Considerations

- Fingerprint is a one-way hash
- Cannot reverse to identify user
- Only stored in the license token (on user's machine)
- Not sent to Tuish servers during verification

### Stability

The fingerprint is stable across:
- ✅ Reboots
- ✅ App updates
- ✅ Minor OS updates

May change on:
- ⚠️ Username change
- ⚠️ Hostname change
- ⚠️ Major OS reinstall

## OTP Security

Terminal purchase uses SMS OTP:

| Measure | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 5-minute expiry | Limits attack window |
| Single use | Prevents replay |
| Rate limiting | Prevents brute force |
| Phone verification | Proves identity |

### Limitations

SMS OTP is not perfect:
- SIM swapping attacks exist
- SMS can be intercepted

For the threat model of CLI licensing, SMS OTP provides reasonable security. For higher-security needs, browser checkout with Stripe's 3DS is available.

## Data Retention

| Data | Retention |
|------|-----------|
| Developer accounts | Until deletion requested |
| License records | Until product deleted |
| API logs | 30 days |
| Error logs | 7 days |

### Data Deletion

Developers can:
- Delete their account via CLI or dashboard
- All associated data is removed within 30 days

End users can:
- Delete local license files (`~/.tuish/`)
- No server-side data to delete

## Compliance

### GDPR

- Minimal data collection
- Clear consent for data processing
- Data portability (export via API)
- Right to deletion

### PCI DSS

- Tuish never handles card data
- All payments through Stripe
- Stripe handles PCI compliance
