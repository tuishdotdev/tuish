# Licenses API

The licenses API provides online validation for additional security beyond offline verification.

## Get License

GET /v1/licenses/:id
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "lic_xxx",
  "productId": "prod_xxx",
  "customerId": "cus_xxx",
  "status": "active",
  "features": ["pro", "beta"],
  "issuedAt": 1704067200000,
  "expiresAt": 1735689600000
}
```

## Validate License

```http
POST /v1/licenses/:id/validate
```

Validates a license online, checking for revocation.

  "machineFingerprint": "machine_xxx"
}
```

### Response (Valid)

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "license": {
    "id": "lic_xxx",
    "status": "active",
    "features": ["pro"],
    "expiresAt": null
  }
}
```

### Response (Invalid)

## License Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `active` | License is valid and usable |
| `expired` | License has passed its expiration date |
| `revoked` | License was manually revoked |

## When to Use Online Validation

Offline verification is usually sufficient, but online validation is useful for:

- **High-security applications** - Verify license hasn't been revoked
- **Subscription products** - Check subscription is still active
- **Feature flags** - Get latest feature entitlements from server

The SDK handles this automatically with configurable refresh intervals.
